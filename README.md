LLADI
=====

The Language Learning Application Development Interface is an Online Tool developed by Samuel Blumire to
facilitate the free and open platform creation of Online, Language Learning Environments.

This version is modified so that it can be run on Daniel's computer:

 - I made a flask virtual python environment (.gitignore'd due to practicality reasons) in a folder called flask in LLADI repo
 - I have had to change a few of the paths (for example where the database is)
